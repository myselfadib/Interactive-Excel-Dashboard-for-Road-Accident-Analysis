## Important Note on Data
Due to the large size of the dataset used in this project, it is hosted externally. You can access the full dataset and the Excel dashboard via this Google Drive link https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ghd2HN3-q5QhYWp7QGmgQiS3OZ3ovaVE?usp=drive_link

## Project Overview
This GitHub repository hosts an interactive Excel dashboard designed to provide a comprehensive analysis of road accident data. The dashboard utilizes advanced data processing techniques to visualize and interpret key metrics related to road accident severity, locations, vehicle types involved, and other critical factors. By leveraging over 307,000 rows of data, this project highlights the robust capabilities of Excel for large-scale data management and detailed visual analytics.

## Features
- Interactive Dashboard: A dynamic user interface that allows users to interactively filter and view data based on various parameters such as accident severity, geographical locations (urban vs. rural), and road conditions.
- Custom Visualizations: Includes a variety of charts and graphs such as donut charts, bar graphs, and line charts that provide visual summaries of the data, making it easier to digest and analyze.
- Advanced Data Processing: Utilizes calculated fields, advanced Excel formulas (such as TEXT, VLOOKUP), and pivot tables to enhance the dataset's analytical capabilities.
- Dynamic Slicers: Allows users to filter the entire dashboard based on specific criteria (e.g., urban vs. rural accidents) with slicers linked to multiple pivot tables and charts for real-time data exploration.
- Data Cleaning and Preparation: Detailed data cleaning steps including handling missing values, correcting typographical errors, and standardizing data entries to ensure data integrity.

## Insights and Analysis

The dashboard provides insightful analytics, enabling a deeper understanding of:
- Accident Severity Distribution: Breakdown of accidents into fatal, serious, and slight categories, highlighting critical areas for intervention.
- Location-Based Trends: Analysis of accidents by location to identify high-risk areas.
- Vehicle Involvement: Insights into which types of vehicles are most frequently involved in accidents, aiding in targeted safety measures.
- Temporal Trends: Monthly and yearly analysis to detect patterns and trends in accident data.
- Environmental Factors: Examination of the impact of light conditions and road surfaces on accident occurrences.

## How to Use the Dashboard
- Filtering Data: Use the slicers to select the data you want to explore, such as specific years, quarters, or urban/rural settings.
- Viewing Data: Navigate through the different visual components to understand various aspects of the data.
- Interpreting Visuals: Each chart and graph includes dynamic data labels and annotations to help interpret the data easily.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel: For all data processing, visualization, and dashboard creation tasks.
- GitHub: For repository management and version control.
